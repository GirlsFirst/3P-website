  <h1>About This Website</h1>
<p>
  This website was created as a project for Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program
   by Paula Fuentes, Lizbeth Gonsalez, and Julia Rodano. All three girls were
   participants in either FTC or FRC. Because they have always had dificulties
   understanding what participating in FTC/FRC encompassed, they created this website to help new members.
